# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** Reliable, reproducible IR spectral predictions using ML potentials that can be validated against DFT reference data.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Error Handling & Input Validation

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Error Handling & Input Validation)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase 02 Complete
Last activity: 2026-02-17 — Completed 02-03: CLI validation integration, subprocess timeout, version fix

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 4.9 min
- Total execution time: 0.57 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 4 | 22 min | 5.5 min |
| 02 | 3 | 13 min | 4.3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-03 (4 min), 01-04 (2 min), 02-01 (4 min), 02-02 (4 min), 02-03 (5 min)
- Trend: Consistent fast execution on well-scoped plans

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Focus on refactoring before new features (code quality and reproducibility are prerequisites for distribution)
- Keep all 4 ML model combinations (comparison across combinations is part of thesis methodology)
- Use quality model profile for GSD agents (important project, want thorough analysis and planning)
- Reproducibility over pip-installability (thesis needs clone-and-reproduce, not package distribution yet)
- [Phase 01]: Moved dev dependencies from orphaned [project] key to [dependency-groups] section for proper uv lockfile inclusion
- [Phase 01-03]: Vib-E2 section has 14 values per mode (freq + thermodynamic properties), not just frequencies; test first N entries
- [Phase 01-03]: Import only pure numerical functions from mode_matching to avoid formchk dependency in tests
- [Phase 01-04]: Used range-based frequency assertions (not exact values) for regression test robustness
- [Phase 01-04]: CH4 harmonic has 4 entries (collapsed degenerate modes), not 9
- [Phase 02-02]: Created exceptions.py and validation.py inline as Plan 01 prerequisites (Rule 3 blocking)
- [Phase 02-02]: Used lazy import (try/except ImportError) for validation module in results_manager
- [Phase 02-02]: Default strict=False preserves backward compatibility for anharmonic-type parsers
- [Phase 02-03]: Timeout tests gracefully handle gm_main import failures (heavy deps like DGL/espaloma)
- [Phase 02-03]: Validation only on run command, not list/diagnose/compare/export

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 considerations:**
- Acetic acid parser bug (commit a4384c4) needs test case to capture expected vs actual behavior
- Coverage targets should be pragmatic (focus on parsers, mode matching, calculators — not necessarily 100%)

**Phase 5 known complexity:**
- MACE module loading requires deeper research on importlib.util patterns for isolated loading
- CUDA initialization state management needs careful handling
- Rollback strategy needed if lazy imports fail
