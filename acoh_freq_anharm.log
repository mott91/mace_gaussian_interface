          Vibrational Energies at Anharmonic Level
     ==================================================

 Units: Vibrational energies and rotational constants in cm^-1.
 NOTE: Transition energies are given with respect to the ground state.

 NOTE: H and L indicates if there is a high or low overlap with the
       state to which it is assigned. In absence of indicator, the state
       is unchanged or nearly unchanged after variational correction.
